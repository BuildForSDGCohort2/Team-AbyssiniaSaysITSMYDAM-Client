        There are by far more different and unique flavor profiles to be found in Ethiopia than in any other coffee-producing country. This is thanks to the incredible geographical, genotypic, and cultural variety within this ancient country.
Because of all this variety, Ethiopia can sometimes be a challenging place to do business, but the reward is worth it. This website will help you navigate the beautiful variety of coffee lands and coffee offerings that make up the motherland of coffee.
