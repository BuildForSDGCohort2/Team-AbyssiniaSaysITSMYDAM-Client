      title: 'Harar',
      coffeeCharacteristics:` Practically all coffee from Harrar is sun-dried natural.
       There are several heirloom varietals that grow specifically in this region, that interact well with the altitude, climate, and soil type to produce a very unique flavor profiles.
        Quality Harrar coffees are notable for a fruity characteristic and a creamy body. The finest Harrar coffees have a distinct note of blueberry, though many other fruity and fruit-like aromatic flavors can occur. 
        One kind of differentiated coffee that comes out of the Harrar area is the “amber bean” or “golden bean coffee.” The reference here is to the appearance of the milled, unroasted coffee, which is yellowish/amber in color. However, it is important to realize that this color can come result from more than one process, and there is more than one flavor profile associated with amber bean coffee. 
      One type of amber coffee is apparently the result of a certain varietal growing in a certain soil type
      in East Harrar. This is “naturally occurring” amber bean coffee, and often has an excellent, vibrant and rich blueberry flavor.
Because of the premium that amber bean Harrar coffee has demanded in the past, some producers have begun selecting out yellowish beans from larger lots of “regular” coffee, and using these hand-selected beans to create smaller “amber bean” lots. However, amber lots created this way do not necessarily have a superior flavor, and can even have an inferior flavor. In fact, one of the ways amber lots are created is using past-crop coffee that has turned yellow from age. Nevertheless, this coffee can still fetch a premium because some foreign buyers simply see “amber coffee from Harrar.” The best way to avoid this kind of confusion, as always, is to obtain a sample and cup it for flavor.
East Harrar coffees tend to have the most distinct blueberry flavors, for which the region is famous. However, in blind cupping, West Harrar coffees and even Bale and Arsi coffees can outscore East Harrar lots. Often West Harrar coffees have a thicker, smoother body, and a milder fruit flavor.
It is important to note that some growing areas that are geographically located in the West Harrar region are nevertheless classified as East Harrar coffees. This is because the coffees grown there have the distinct East Harrar profile. This phenomenon is limited to the southeastern most communities of West Harrar, the ones that border along East Harrar, as one would expect.
Harrar coffee is exported all over the world, but there is a particular demand for it in Saudi Arabia. This constant demand tends to keep the price for commercial grade Harrar coffee slightly higher than most other Ethiopian coffee regions.

      coffeeDesignations: `Harrar coffee — all of which is unwashed — is available in specialty grade and commercial grade.
      Commercial grade coffees are given a grade between 3 and 9, and are designated geographically by the letters A, B, C, and D. Remember, the letters do not represent grades, only geographical categories. The purchasing center for all Harrar coffees is the city of Dire Dawa
Harrar A: East Harrar, plus the geographically western locations of Hirna, Gemechisa, Debesso, Messela, Gerawa, Gewgew, and Dire Dawa Zuria.
Harrar B: West Harrar, excluding the locations designated under Harrar A.
Harrar C: Arsi and Golelecha
Harrar D: Bale, West Arsi (Nansebo), and the location of Chole.
Specialty grade Harrar coffees are given a grade of Q1 or Q2. They are also given the same letter designations, A, B, C, and D. There is also a fifth letter designation, E, in Harrar that applies only to coffees from Hirna and Messela, which are grouped with Harrar A in commercial coffee.
Harrar E: Hirna and Messela (specialty grade only).`,

      title: 'Sidama',
      coffeeCharacteristics: `Sidama features an extraordinarily wide variety of coffee flavors. Many different grades of both washed and unwashed coffees are produced, and there can be striking differences from town to town.
      Varying soil types, micro climates, and especially the countless heirloom coffee tree varietals make for a kaleidoscope of different flavors. It is difficult to make any single description of Sidama coffees, without immediately encountering another coffee that fits a completely different profile. The strength of Sidama lies in its variety.
      One feature of excellent Sidama coffee is often a profound complexity. This derives from the many different heirloom varietals. Many different farmers and pickers, each with a very small patch of land, often with their own unique varietals, will pool their coffees at a cooperative. The resulting “blend” is a unique expression of the complexity of the horticulture in the surrounding area.
      High grade unwashed Sidama coffees are known for their intense fruity characteristics, while being of somewhat lighter body than unwashed Harrar coffees, for example.
      Another striking characteristic of Sidama coffees is that even the washed coffees often retain a salient fruity characteristic, while having much more clarity and brightness than their unwashed counterparts.
      Excellent coffees of many different profiles can be found in all corners of Sidama.`,
      coffeeDesignations: `Sidama coffees are given three tags: a grade, a geographical letter designation, and designation as washed or unwashed. Remember the letters do not represent a quality designation, only a geographical region.
      All washed coffees and some unwashed coffees from Bale and Arsi are categorized, by flavor characteristics, with Sidama.
Hawassa is the main arrival center for Sidama, though some coffees are sold through the hub of Soddo.
Commercial grade washed coffees are given a grade of 3 through 9, and are divided into the following three geographical sub regions:
Sidama A: Borena, Benssa, Guji, Chire, Bona Zuria, Arroressa, Arbigona, Bale, Arsi, and West Arsi. [Hawassa arrival]
Sidama B: Aleta Wendo, Dale, Chiko, Dara, Shebedino, Amaro, Dilla Zuria, Wensho, and Loko Abaya. [Hawassa]
Sidama C: Kembata & Timbaro, Wellayta, South Omo, and Gamogoffa. [Soddo]
Designations for specialty grade washed coffees are Q1 and Q2 with the following geographical sub regions (some of which are different than they are for commercial grade coffees):
Sidama A: Borena, Benssa, Guji, Chire, Bona Zuria, Arroressa, Arbigona [Hawassa]
Sidama B: Aleta Wendo, Dale, Chuko, Dara, Shebedino, Wensho, Loko Abaya, Amaro, Dilla Zuria [Hawassa]
Sidama C: Kembata & Timbaro, Wellayta [Soddo]
Sidama D: West Arsi (Nansebo), Arsi (Chole), and Bale [Hawassa]
Sidama E: South Omo, and Gamogoffa [Soddo]
Commercial grade unwashed coffees are divided into the following letter groupings:
Sidama A: Borena, Benssa, Guji, Arbigona, Chire, Bona Zuria, and Arroressa [Hawassa]
Sidama B: Aleta Wendo, Dale, Chiko, Dara, Shebedino, Amaro, Wensho, Loko Abaya, and Amaro [Hawassa]
Sidama C: Kembata & Timbaro, Wellayta [Soddo]
Sidama D: Bale, West Arsi (Nansebo), Arsi (Chole) [Hawassa]
Sidama E: Debub Omo, Gamogoffa, Basketo, Derashe, Konso, Konta, Dawro [Soddo]
Specialty grade washed coffees use the same letter groupings as specialty grade unwashed coffees, with the exception of the letter E grouping, which is as follows:
Sidama E: South Ari, North Ari, Melo, Denba Gofa, Geze Gofa, Arbaminch Zuria, Basketo, Derashe, Konso, Konta, Gena Bosa, and Esera [Soddo]`,

      title: 'Yirgacheffe',
      coffeeCharacteristics: `Top grade Yirgacheffe coffees share many characteristics with the best Sidama coffees. Fruit flavors, a bright acidity, and a silky mouthfeel are some of its hallmarks.
      Yirgacheffe produces both washed and unwashed coffees. While it originally became famous mostly for its washed coffees, recent years have seen the export of some highly sought-after top-rate unwashed coffees as well.
      Top grade washed coffees from Yirgacheffe are renowned for bright citrus acidity, often with a lemony character, with excellent sweetness. The other hallmarks of the coffee is a light, herbaceous quality that compliments the fruit flavors well, for a complex and flavorful coffee.
      The best unwashed coffees from Yirgacheffe often retain a high degree of acidity, with softer fruit flavors and sometimes berry characteristics.`,
      coffeeDesignations: `All Yirgacheffe coffees are given a grade, as well as a letter characteristic, either A or B. Unlike with the other large coffee regions, these letters do indeed make a qualitative distinction. For all Yirgacheffe coffees, the letter A designates “coffee having Yirgacheffe flavor”; the letter B designates “coffee lacking Yirgacheffe flavor.
      It is possible to find specialty grade coffees among the B category. These would be coffees with excellent cup characteristics, but characteristics that cannot be considered “classic Yirgacheffe flavor.”
      The delivery center for all Yirgachefe coffees is the nearby large town of Dilla.
      All commercial grade coffee, washed and unwashed, graded 3 through 9, is simply called Yirgacheffe A or Yirgacheffe B. Both categories include the four Yirgacheffe zones:
      Yirgachefe A: Yirgachefe, Wenago, Kochere, Gelena/Abaya
      Yirgachefe B: Yirgachefe, Wenago, Kochere, Gelena/Abaya
      Specialty grade coffee, both washed and unwashed, graded Q1 and Q2, is given a designation by one of the four zones in Yirgacheffe. The A and B designations, once again, refer to the presence or lack of classic Yirgacheffe flavor.`,
